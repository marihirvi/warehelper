# WareHelper

This repository contains the code for my solution to Reaktor's assignment for junior developers for Spring 2021.
The application is running on [Heroku](https://rocky-falls-72380.herokuapp.com/).

## Assignment brief

Your client is a clothing brand that is looking for a simple web app to use in their warehouses. To do their work efficiently, the warehouse workers need a fast and simple listing page per product category, where they can check simple product and availability information from a single UI.

## Technologies used

The solution is built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) framework.

## Building on MacOS
