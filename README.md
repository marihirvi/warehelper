# WareHelper

This repository contains the code for my solution to Reaktor's assignment for junior developers for Spring 2021. The application is running on [Heroku](https://rocky-falls-72380.herokuapp.com/).

## Assignment brief

The brief was to create a simple product listing app for warehouse workers:
> Your client is a clothing brand that is looking for a simple web app to use in their warehouses. To do their work efficiently, the warehouse workers need a fast and simple listing page per product category, where they can check simple product and availability information from a single UI.

I built the app as a React web app using JavaScript. Rather than the UI, the focus was on creating an app that works with two non-optimal legacy APIs. However, I was interested in learning to use a React component library, so I used the React Boostrap front-end framework. As an extra feature, I implemented a Bootstrap-based pagination that works together with the React router.
